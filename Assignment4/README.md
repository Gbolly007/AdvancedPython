# Advanced Python Programming - Assignment 4

# 1. 
A program that counts and summarizes the total number of operators for a given set of distinct operators (n1 = 20):.

# 2. 
Extend your program to count distinct operands (n2 = 5) and summarize the total number of operands (N2).

# 3. 
Deriving operands from previous notation: n = n1 + n2, N = N1 + N2, ....

# 4. 
Give us an intuitive explanation why the formula of estimating program length uses logarithm to base 2

# 5. 
Formating and documenting cose
