# Advanced Python Programming - Assignment 3

# 1. 'Create a decorator'.
Create a decorator that dumps original source code of the function.

# 2. 'Extend decorator'.
First, extend your decorator so that it can work with any arbitrary function (ie with any signature). Second, let it dump a bit more information:

# 3. 'Apply decorator against its own definition'.
Now, apply your @reflect decorator against its own definition! Does your head start spinning? Is that possible? If no why? Put a brief comment in the "main" section and give us workaround instead:

# 4. 'Add an extra attribute.'
Now, we're going to add one more attribute. This time it will be a Complexity! We promised to be easy this turn. So we just want you to prepare for the next assignment. Modify your decorator so that it shows Complx: which counts one particular word from within the Source:. The word might be for, print or if

# 5. 'Complete python module'
Finally, make out of your decorator's code a complete python module (singe-filed though)! We want you to be able to import it as a good library for your own needs. The foo function you can surely throw away.
