# Advanced Python Programming - Assignment 2 ('Russian hacker')

# 1. 
Write a program that takes N arbitrary .py les and creates a neat table out of their execution time ranking by who-is-faster..

# 2. 
Task is to reveal what the beast the "bytecode" is. To start something from, write a program that yield opcodes (and their arguments) for ordinary python programs. The opcodes are "machine" in- structions produced out of your program for executing them on Python Virtual Machine. 

# 3. 
Getting bytecode out of other sources? For example, code snippets and already compiled. pyc files (which you might encounter under pycache folder).

# 4. 
Extend your program to produce (compile) .py files or code snippets right into .pyc. Don't bother about processing multiple files, or providing additional  ags to change output dir or name.

# 5. 'Pedant coder'
Introduce new action compare. It must compare bytecode among different sources and produce neat table with stats of the used opcodes (and only them).
